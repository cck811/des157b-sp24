                <h2> "Wealth Inequality in America: What It Looks Like and Why It Happens" – Pew Research Center, 2020.</h2>

                    <h3><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/">Click here to go to article</a></h3>

                    <p>This article from Pew Research Center dives deep into the issues of wealth inequality in America, focusing on how it looks and why it's happening. It's super useful for my project because it provides hard data and expert analysis on the distribution of wealth which can help back up any claims I make. Pew is all about bringing facts to the public without taking sides, so their findings are pretty reliable. They conclude that wealth inequality is not just sticking around but might get worse, which is crucial for my project as it underlines the need for exploring solutions through design.</p>

                <h2>"Global Wealth Inequality" – The World Bank, 2019.</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/isp#:~:text=The%20world's%20poorest%20people%20bore,the%20first%20time%20in%20decades.">Click here to go to article</a></h3>
                    <p>The World Bank’s report on global wealth inequality gives a broad look at how wealth is spread out across different countries and what that means for everyone. It’s really helpful for my project because it discusses economic stability and how countries deal with inequality. Since the World Bank is a big name in global economics, their insights are super credible and detailed. They point out that different policies have varied impacts, which helps me think about what might happen if different economic strategies are applied in my speculative designs.</p>

                <h2>"Funding our nation’s priorities: Reforming the tax code’s advantageous treatment of the wealthy" – Brookings Institution, 2021.</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/funding-our-nations-priorities-reforming-the-tax-codes-advantageous-treatment-of-the-wealthy/">Click here to go to article</a></h3>
                    <p>Brookings Institution's article tackles how tax policy impacts economic inequality in the U.S. This is spot-on for my project because it explores the direct effects of fiscal decisions on wealth gaps. The article is packed with evidence on recent tax laws and is a solid source because Brookings is known for in-depth research. They conclude that tax policies can significantly shape economic inequality, which backs up my project's focus on how different decisions can lead to different futures. This article is key for arguing that thoughtful policy changes could lead to a fairer society in my project scenarios.</p>
