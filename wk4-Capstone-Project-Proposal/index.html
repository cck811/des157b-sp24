                    <h2>Introduction to the Topic</h2>
                    <p>For my capstone project, I’ve chosen the overwhelming issue of wealth disparity and economic inequality, which really affect societies worldwide. The target audience is policymakers, educational bodies, and just anyone interested in fixing economic disparities. My plan is to use interactive and speculative designs to provoke challenges to the common thoughts about wealth and poverty, and think about how we could create a future of fairness, a balance of equity and equality.</p>

                    <h2>Theoretical Lenses</h2>
                    <p>This project will use speculative design to show what utopian and dystopian futures might look like based on our current economic paths. It aims to make viewers see the possible long-term impacts of what we do today. A big part of the project is challenging how people think about wealth, like the wrong belief that poverty is all about personal failures. I’ll use data visualizations to make the complex data on wealth distribution simpler to understand, showing what could happen with different economic policies. We can also look at stories of possible bright or scary futures, making viewers think about how different choices can lead to very different outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Project Features</h2>
                    <p>The project will have interactive simulations where users can try out economic policies and see how they might affect wealth distribution in the long term. I want there to also be story-driven parts where users can hear from people in different economic situations (maybe from YouTube?). I’m also putting in feedback mechanisms in the project, so users can react to the info and share their own views, which helps make the data better.</p>

                    <h2>Potential Challenges and Concerns</h2>
                    <p>There are a few challenges I might run into with this project. One is keeping the economic theories and data simple enough to be accessible, but not too simple. There’s also the tech challenge of making sure the interactive stuff works well on different devices. And ethically, it’s really important to present the data and stories in a way that doesn’t just reinforce stereotypes or biases.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Overall, this project is about more than just showing data—it’s a chance to really engage with people and maybe change how they think about wealth and poverty. By letting users explore and interact with what might happen in the future, I hope to not only teach but also inspire actions towards a more fair world.</p>
