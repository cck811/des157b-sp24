        <li>Start with the IIFE and <code>'use strict'</code> directive, then add a variable that holds a string.</li>
        <li>Assign a famous quote to the variable you just created.</li>
        <li>Create a named function that takes a string as an argument, then outputs to the console the number of characters in the string, and then outputs to the console a statement that says "here is the full string:" followed by the famous quote assigned to the variable.</li>
        <li>Call the function passing in the variable you created.</li>
