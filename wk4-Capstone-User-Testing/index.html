                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the user testing was to evaluate the effectiveness of the interactive web project in helping users understand the impact of different economic conditions on wealth disparity.</p>
                    <p>The web project aimed to challenge the misconception that people are poor due to personal choices or laziness, by demonstrating how environmental and systemic factors can lead to different economic outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Testing Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Moderated, in-person user testing sessions were conducted.</p>
                    <p>The target audience was students in a web design class, with varying levels of familiarity with the topic.</p>
                    <p>Two participants were involved in the testing.</p>
                    <p>The testing environment was a controlled classroom setting.</p>

                        <p>Task description: From the intro page, users were asked to navigate to the interactive simulator page.</p>
                        <p>Expected outcome: Users should be able to find and click the "START" button to access the simulator.</p>
                      </li>

                        <p>Task description: Users were instructed to interact with the four sliders (Tax Rate, Minimum Wage, Social Welfare, and Market Forces) and observe the changes in the image section.</p>
                        <p>Expected outcome: Users should be able to adjust the sliders and see the corresponding changes in the image, reflecting different economic outcomes based on the selected conditions.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>

                    <h2>Test Facilitation</h2>
                    <p>Participants were given a brief overview of the project and instructed to complete the tasks while verbalizing their thoughts and actions.</p>
                    <p>No warm-up exercises were conducted.</p>
                    <p>The moderator's role was to guide participants through the tasks, answer questions, and take notes on their observations and feedback.</p>

                    <h2>Analysis and Reporting</h2>
                    <p>Qualitative analysis was performed on the observations and feedback collected during the testing sessions.</p>
                    <p>The reporting format will be a summary report highlighting key findings, user comments, and recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Recommendations and action items based on findings:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Improve the image transition when changing conditions in the simulator for a smoother experience.</li>
                        <li>Clarify the purpose of the comment section or consider moving it to a separate page.</li>
                        <li>Revisit the font and layout of the intro page for better accessibility and readability.</li>
                        <li>Consider adding a character or guide to make the design more relatable and "human".</li>
                        <li>Shorten the intro page content and make it more concise.</li>
                        <li>Enhance the visibility of the image description on the simulator page.</li>
                        <li>Add a "back" button to allow users to return to the intro page from the simulator page.</li>
